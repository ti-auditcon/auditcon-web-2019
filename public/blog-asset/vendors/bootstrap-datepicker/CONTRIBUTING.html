<p>The issue tracker is not the place for support requests.  If you get stuck with bootstrap-datepicker, it&#39;s very likely that the fine folks at <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> will be able to help you; simply describe the problem you&#39;re having and provide them a link to the repo (so they know what code you&#39;re using).  Another option is to post to the <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bootstrap-datepicker">bootstrap-datepicker google group</a>.</p>
<h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>
<p>If you&#39;ve found a bug in bootstrap-datepicker, we want to know about it!  However, please keep the following in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not the bootstrap-datepicker from <a href="http://www.eyecon.ro/bootstrap-datepicker/">eyecon.ro</a>.  Stefan provided the initial code for bootstrap-datepicker, but this repo is divergent from his codebase.  Please make sure you&#39;re using either the latest tagged version or the latest master from <a href="https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker/">https://github.com/uxsolutions/bootstrap-datepicker/</a>.</li>
<li>A working example of the bug you&#39;ve found is <em>much</em> easier to work with than a  description alone.  If possible, please provide a link to a demonstration of the bug, perhaps using <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">http://jsfiddle.net/</a> .<ul>
<li>CDN-backed assets can be found at <a href="http://bsdp-assets.blackcherry.us/">http://bsdp-assets.blackcherry.us/</a> .  These should be used <em>only</em> for building test cases, as they may be removed or changed at any time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, it&#39;s possible someone else has already reported the same bug you have.  Please search the issue tracker for similar issues before posting your own.  Thanks!</li>
</ul>
