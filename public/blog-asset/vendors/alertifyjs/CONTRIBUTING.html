<h4 id="did-you-find-a-bug-"><strong>Did you find a bug?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Ensure the bug was not already reported</strong> by searching on GitHub under <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/issues">Issues</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you&#39;re unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/issues/new">open a new one</a>. Be sure to include a <strong>title and clear description</strong>, as much relevant information as possible, and a <strong>code sample</strong> or an <strong>executable test case</strong> demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="did-you-write-a-patch-that-fixes-a-bug-"><strong>Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Use the <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/tree/develop">develop branch</a>, not the master branch.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Before submitting, ensure that there are tests for any new functionality, and that all tests (including coding style tests) are passing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="do-you-intend-to-add-a-new-feature-or-change-an-existing-one-"><strong>Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Suggest your change by opening an <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/issues/new">new issue</a>. If the response is positive start writing code.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="development-process">Development Process</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>To update the stylesheet, make changes to the <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/tree/master/src/sass/alertify.scss">src/sass/alertify.scss</a> file</p>
</li>
<li><p>To update the core javascript, make changes to the <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/tree/master/src/js/alertify.js">src/js/alertify.js</a> file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep in mind the style guide as defined in the ESLint file, as PRs are automatically tested for code style.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don&#39;t include minified resources - anything in the <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/tree/master/dist">dist</a> directory. Team members will
rebuild all those files for added security. If you do include changes by accident that&#39;s fine. We&#39;ll just overwrite them to be sure.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="do-you-want-to-contribute-to-the-documentation-"><strong>Do you want to contribute to the documentation?</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>The documentation is found in the <a href="https://github.com/alertifyjs/alertify.js/tree/master/website">website</a> directory. Edit it in there and send a PR.</li>
</ul>
